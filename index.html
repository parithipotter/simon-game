        Made by Potter with ðŸ’œ.
        <p>The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it.
          The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
          In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's
          memory is more and more solicited. <br>
          <br>
          1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated
          to the key. <br> <br>
          2- The player has to press the same key. <br> <br>
          3- Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly. <br> <br>
          4- The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory. <br> <br>
          5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the
          player's memory is put to the test. <br> <br>
          6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game! <br> <br>
